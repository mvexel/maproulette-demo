# Place Addresses on Restaurants

Many restaurants in OpenStreetMap are missing addresses. This
challenge works to fix that by hilighting restaurants without an
address.

To fix a restaurant, load it up in your editor and add the following fields:

* `addr:street`
* `addr:housenumber`
* `addr:city`

In addition, you may want to add

* `website`

for the restaurant's website.
